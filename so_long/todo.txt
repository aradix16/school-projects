TODO:
				- implement transition for moving from 0 to +50px
				- deal with state animation (0 sleep, 1 walk-a, 2 walk-b)
				- update boundaries on each player move
				- check if player stay on the map
				- check for collectbles / exit
				- "randomness" with textures (ground, obstacles, collectibles)
				- implement the "waking up" animation:
				basic animation:
				0			25			50
				[State1]	[State2]	[State1]

				from sleep state:
				0			0			25 50 [State 0]
[State1] [State2]	[State1]

				- find a good texture for the exit
				- count player steps
				- maybe move the code from "player" in "events" because all the
player moving logic is inside the render/animation code logic
				- add "killer mushroom" and the "dead player" texture + state(3)
				- graphic/render/  graphic/draw/
