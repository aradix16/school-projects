## About my school
[42 school](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) is a non-profit computer programming institution that is completely free and accessible to anyone over 18. With its first campus opened in Paris in 2013, 42 School has grown into an [international network](https://www.42network.org/) of tech campuses, sharing a common curriculum and values.

The school's innovative pedagogy is based on peer-to-peer learning, with no formal teachers or lectures. Instead, creativity is fostered through project-based learning, allowing students to learn from each other and solve problems collaboratively. The institution is open 24/7, promoting a self-paced, immersive learning environment.

## Admission Process
To join 42, applicants must go through an intensive 4-week coding bootcamp called 'la Piscine.' This immersive experience, conducted 7 days a week, covers C programming and bash scripting. No previous programming experience is required, and successful completion allows candidates to register as full-time students at 42.

## The Norm
[The Norm](https://github.com/42Paris/norminette) is 42's coding style guideline, applicable to all C programs. Adhering to strict coding standards is crucial, with a single Norm Error resulting in a grade of 0/100. Key norms include:
* forbidden functions: almost all the Standard C Library functions except read, open, write, malloc and free for some projects
* 25 lines per function maximum (without external brackets) and 84 characters per line maximum
* no more than 5 functions in a .c file and no more than 5 variables per function, no comments within a function's body
* for loops are forbidden
